== What does it do? ==

Check out the user-friendly features of this awesome plugin:

- **Import**: Import tickets from Zendesk, Helpscout and Ticksy using our free importer add-on - makes for a seamless transition to your new helpdesk
- **E-mail notifications**: relevant parties are notified of certain actions by e-mail, and all e-mails are customizable. Choose from a selection of six email notifications (new ticket, reply to agent, reply to client etc.)
- **Restricted access**: all correspondence is private between the client and the agents (unless the PUBLIC TICKETS premium add-on is installed and configured)

- **Terms & conditions**: ask users to agree to your your terms and conditions before they open a ticket
- **Old tickets**: identify old tickets quickly with tags; limit your viewable ticket list to only show old tickets with just a couple of clicks
- **Tickets waiting on you**: Quickly see all tickets still waiting for a reply - two clicks is all it takes to limit your ticket list to only those tickets!
- **Agent Collaboration**: multiple agents can work on the same ticket and tickets can be transferred between agents; assign primary, secondary and tertiary agents to tickets while retaining the flexibility to transfer a ticket to any other agent.
- **Sorting And Filtering**: includes an amazing flexible sorting, filtering and tagging system for your tickets
- **Security**: assign just the right capabilities to each of your agents including just the ability to see their own tickets or expand to see everyone's tickets - your choice!

- **Time Tracking**: basic time tracking is included!  Admins can even adjust time and all time changes are logged directly in the ticket. 
- **Custom Labels**: sign up for our email newsletter and get our Custom Status plugin for free - unlimited color coded, customized statuses and ticket labels at your fingertips! Combined with priorities and tags you have the ultimate system for categorizing and tracking your tickets!
- **WordPress UI**: Uses the familiar WordPress administration user interface so there is almost no learning curve!  And, because we respect the WordPress UI standards you can use any 3rd party styling tool to create the look you want (see the screenshots section for examples)

[WPML Instructions](https://getawesomesupport.com/documentation/awesome-support/wpml-introduction/)
[POLYLANG Instructions](https://getawesomesupport.com/documentation/awesome-support/polylang-introduction/)

== Installation ==

= Using The WordPress Dashboard =

1. Navigate to the 'Add New' in the plugins dashboard
2. Search for 'Awesome Support'
3. Click 'Install Now'
4. Activate the plugin on the Plugin dashboard

= Uploading in WordPress Dashboard =

1. Download `awesome-support.zip` from this page
2. Navigate to the 'Add New' in the plugins dashboard
3. Navigate to the 'Upload' area
4. Select `awesome-support.zip` from your computer
5. Click 'Install Now'
6. Activate the plugin in the Plugin dashboard

= Using FTP =

1. Download `awesome-support.zip` from this page
2. Extract the `awesome-support` directory to your computer
3. Upload the `awesome-support` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
4. Activate the plugin in the Plugin dashboard

= Setup =

Whatever the method you used, after you activated the plugin through the plugins dashboard, the setup is done silently in the background.

Two new pages will be added to your site:

- My Tickets
- Submit ticket

Add those two pages to your menu in order to give your users easy access to their support area.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I've installed the plugin - now what? =

Now you can [read our post installation instructions](https://getawesomesupport.com/documentation/awesome-support/post-installation-need-know-quick-start/) or [watch the installation videos](https://getawesomesupport.com/videos/)

= Weird or scrambled UI in wp-admin on the ticket screen after upgrading to 5.0 =

This can happen because old JS and CSS files are cached in your browser.  On most browsers you can use the CTRL-F5 key on any Awesome Support page to force a full refresh.

= Missing tabs or menu options after upgrading from version 3.x to 5.x =

This happens because new WordPress custom security capabilities were introduced in version 4.0.0 of Awesome Support.  [Read this FAQ on our site to learn how adjust your system for these new security items.](https://getawesomesupport.com/question/missing-tabs-menu-options-version-4-0-upgrade/)

= I get a blank page after ticket submission =

This is most likely a permalinks issue. What you need to do is log into your WordPress admin, go to *Settings > Permalinks* and hit the *Save* button. You don't actually need to change anything, just hitting *Save* will refresh your permalinks structure, including the new `ticket` post type.

= The plugin data isn't removed from the database after uninstall =

If you want to delete the plugin and all of its data, you need to go to the *Advanced* tab in the plugin settings and check the *Delete Data* option. Only then the data will be removed from the database during the uninstall process.

= Users get "You do not have the capacity to open a new ticket" =

Normally, when a user registers through the plugin, he/she is given the role *Support User*. [This role has special capabilities](http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities).

If your users get the error message *"You do not have the capacity to open a new ticket"*, it means that they don't have the special capabilities.  This can happen when you install into an existing site and your users already have a role assigned.

Here you have two choices:

1. Change all your users' role to *Support User*
2. Give the role you want to use (eg. *Subscriber*) the special capabilities

If you don't know how to add new capabilities to a role, we suggest you use a plugin like [User Role Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-role-editor/) and give the desired role the following capabilities:

- `view_ticket`
- `create_ticket`
- `close_ticket`
- `reply_ticket`
- `attach_files`

**Do not give your users more than those 5 capabilities**, otherwise they could get administrative privileges.

= How to disable agent auto-assignment =

If you need to disable the auto-assignment function and hence have all new tickets assigned to the default agent (set in the plugin general settings), you can add this constant in your theme's `functions.php` file:

`
define( 'WPAS_DISABLE_AUTO_ASSIGN', true );
`

= How to set the product field as mandatory? =

If you have enabled multi-products support and want to make the "Product" field in the submission form mandatory, just add the following code snippet to your theme's `functions.php` file: https://gist.github.com/julien731/a519956ce9c81542439c. Alternatively, if you don't want to mess with code you can pick up our POWERPACK add-on where you can tick a box to turn this feature on.

= How to change the tickets slug? =

By default, all tickets will be accessed through a URL of the type domain.com/ticket/my-ticket-title.

If you wish to change the slug `ticket` to something else, let's say `help`, so that your URLs look like domain.com/help/my-ticket-title, you need to add a constant in your theme's `functions.php` file as follows:

`
define( 'WPAS_SLUG', 'my_new_slug' );
`

= I don't receive e-mail notifications =

There are several factors that can influence e-mail notifications delivery. Please read this article for details: https://getawesomesupport.com/email-notifications-awesome-support-wordpress/

== Changelog ==

= 5.8.0 =
***This version requires upgrades to some of your add-ons: Custom FAQ, Documentation, FAQs, Smart Replies, Powerpack and Public Tickets***
The version 5.x line is a MAJOR upgrade from 4.x  
If you are upgrading from 4.x or or earlier versions it is strongly suggested that you test this upgrade in a stage/test environment before applying it to your production site.
Please make sure that you back-up your site before applying this update!

* Security Fixes
	* Ensure that drag-and-drop uploads only allow approved file extensions.

* New
	* Integrate the REST API into the core. Turn it on using the new settings tab in TICKETS->SETTINGS->REST API.
	* Add new tab on privacy screen to submit a request to export ALL system data to the admin (not just tickets)
	* Replace icon images on ticket screen in wp-admin with a true icon file - helps scale up properly on higher resolution screens.
	* Added the concept of an OVERLAY to the AS theme 
	* Added four overlays - "Subtle", "Angle", "Dark" and "Orange"
	
* Fix
	* Entering an email address into the WP personal data eraser that does not match a user is allowed by WP. That led AS to delete ALL tickets when the personal data eraser was run for that invalid email address.
	* Editing a reply did not show the text editor, just the html editor.
	* Delete temporary drag-and-drop folders 24 hours after creation.  This prevents them from accidentally being deleted immediately if uploads or processing is slow.
	* Polylang and other schemes that duplicated the AS ticket pages would end up with the privacy popup not being hidden by default.
	
* Tweak
	* Add-ons page can now read 'single server' license pricing for certain add-ons.
	* Modify add-on base class to NOT show a license warning if an itemid has not been set.
	* CSS: Tightened up spacing around the delete 'x' next to attachments
	* CSS: Tightened up spacing around the attachment area when viewing a ticket
	* CSS: Make front-end tickets table responsive.
	* CSS: Removed round border from icons, made icons black and use a subtle dimmed color to indicate when an icon is in-focus
	* Update the EDD SL Licensing Class File - prior versions of AS was loading that file in the WRONG location

* Dev
	* Added a new filter so that add-ons can integrate with our data export process.

= 5.7.1 =

* Security Fixes
	(none)

* Fix
	* Editing the opening ticket post did not respect the logging flags. It would always show the original content in the logs.
	* PHP 5.6 error on static function when rendering the privacy popup.
	* A variable was not declared before being used under certain circumstances (when a right to be forgotten request was being submitted).
	
* Tweak
	* Better error handling for duplicate right-to-be-forgotten requests.
	* Better styling on error messages on privacy popup screen.
	
= 5.7.0 =

* Security Fixes
	(none)
	
* New
	* Add option to allow/deny agents setting the auto-delete attachments flag in wp-admin.
	
* Fix	
	* Privacy popup was not available on single ticket page on front-end.
	* Clean up edit history popup css
	
* Tweak
	* Make edit history popup fullscreen.
	* Move main toolbar inside the ticket opening post area so that the icons conditionally appear on hover.  Saves vertical space.
	
* Dev
	* Add some new filters around the user consents so other add-ons can tie into them.
	* Add new action hook - wpas_custom_field_filters_after - which allows another location for for add-ons to hook into the ticket listing display in wp-admin.

= 5.6.0 =

* Security Fixes
	(none)
	
* New
	* Added fields to hold phone numbers in the user profile.
	
* Fix
	* The function that created user names would not duplicate-check a user name when handed one by the calling program.  This primarily affected the email-support premium addon when the admin chose to use a user name construction method that would result in many commonly used user names.
	* Resolved an issue with labels and some text in the privacy popup when slashes were used.
	* Privacy popup might appear at the bottom of some pages where it really shouldn't appear. 
	* The page numbers at the bottom of the front-end ticket list were being wrapped unnecessarily
	
* Tweak
	* Code to prevent the same email address from being added to the same notification by multiple addons. 
	* Privacy popup is now full screen. Other styling changes were made as well.
	* The privacy popup css was being loaded separately while also being loaded with the minimized css files.
	
* Dev
	* Added a function to return a list of all support users on a ticket - wpas_get_support_users_on_ticket()
	* Added a function to return true/false if the current page is a front-end page belonging to the plugin.  Used for the privacy pop-up fix outlined in the fix section above.
	
= 5.5.1 =
The version 5.x line is a MAJOR upgrade from 4.x  
If you are upgrading from 4.x or or earlier versions it is strongly suggested that you test this upgrade in a stage/test environment before applying it to your production site.
You will also need to upgrade premium add-ons after this upgrade - in particular POWERPACK, FAQ, DOCUMENTATION, CANNED RESPONSES, FILESTACK and CUSTOM FAQ
At the very least you should back-up your site before applying this update!

* Security Fixes
	(none)
	
* Fix
	* A filter for the cron schedules was returning blanks which caused core WP to generate an error because it wasn't expecting void or an empty array.
	* If an attachment is included with a reply that only has a signature (POWERPACK), we needed to let the reply go through instead of considering it a blank reply and ignoring it.
	
= 5.5.0 =

	* Added the ability to drag and drop files in both the ticket and the admin

	* The notification flag for tickets closed by customer was not being respected.
	* The filter for "old" tickets was simply not working
	* Added an empty BS4 css theme file to the awesome support BS4 theme file folder to prevent a file not found error.
	* Cleaned up some help text.
	* Option to hide closed tickets on the frontend was simply not working and it never could have worked.
	* Make sure that the attachments_max option in the file uploader uses a default of 2 instead of no default or a zero default.

	* Started process of renaming all occurrences of the wpas_log help function to wpas_log_history().

	* Renamed incorrectly named action hook from wpas_tikcet_after_saved to wpas_ticket_after_saved

	* Add new action hook at end of ticket details metabox - wpas_backend_ticket_status_after_actions

* Dev
	* Added a new parameter to the wpas_email_notifications_sender_data filter ($this).
	* Fix name on post-render action hook inside the submission form.  It had a '-x' after the name for some reason.
	
= 5.1.0 =

* Security Fixes
	(none)
	
* New
	* Added an onboarding wizard to get users quickly set up after activating the plugin
	* Added option for admin to be able to set the role that a user will be registered with when using our registration page

= 5.0.0 =

* New
	* Simple WooCommerce Integration adds the SUBMIT TICKET and MY TICKET page links to the WooCommerce user dashboard
	* The REPLY editor is now in a tab next to the ATTACHMENTS tab so that the user does not have to keep scrolling endlessly in order to find commonly used functions.  
	* Moved the CUSTOM FIELDS, ADDITIONAL INTERESTED PARTIES and STATISTICS metaboxes inside tabs.  This move saves on vertical space and prevents users from endlessly scrolling down to find key info in metaboxes.
	* Email template tags can now be inserted directly from inside the editor using a new editor button.
	* Added a toolbar to the TICKET DETAIL page that can be used for buttons. 
	* ***possible breaking change*** The submission form was redone to make all fields being used part of the global custom fields array.  Helps with sorting.
	* Hide the ticket SLUG by default.  Can be shown now with a new button on the button bar.  Helps saves some vertical space.
	* Options for changing the location of the log files
	* New version of Eric Mann's wp-session-manager framework which uses custom tables to hold the session data. For larger volume sites this is much more efficient!
	* Added function to check to see if a notice is a license notice and suppress it if we're running in SAAS mode.  This only works for those add-ons that use our core library functions so older add-ons that dont will still show license notices.
	* Added an ORDER attribute for custom fields (will only be used by the premium custom fields add-on for now but can be used to set a sort order and the custom fields array sorted by any developer)
	* Added new attributes for custom fields to allow for pre and post do_action declarations

	* Added new security capability 'assign_ticket_creator'.
	* Added options to control who can see the CUSTOM FIELDS tab in wp-admin
	* Added options to control who can see the ADDITIONAL INTERESTED PARTIES tab in wp-admin
	* Added options to control who can see the TAGS metabox in the ticket screen in wp-admin
	* Added a new base extension class for use by add-ons.  Eventually all add-ons will be converted to use this new class.

* Enh
	* User search drop-downs in ticket admin now shows the user id and email address.  These items can be searched on as well. (Thanks to George Lagonikas of subscriptiongroup.co.uk for submitting this feature to github for the benefit of all users.)
	* Support Agent Dropdown is now a regular drop-down by default, not a SELECT2 drop-down.  
	* Updated SELECT2 library from 4.0.3 to 4.0.5
	* Updated BootStrap 4.0.0 cdn link to point to the final version
	* Added documentation links to the documentation tab for the importer.
	* On small screens, made the "more" button on tabs a "hamburger" icon since its now universally recognizable as a menu	
	
* Dev
	* Explicitly UNDECLARE support for GUTENBERG metaboxes so that the NEW TICKET page will render properly even when the GUTENBERG plug-in is installed.
	* Added a GUTENBERG template for new tickets just in case the GUTENBERG editor ends up being shown for some reason. (Under normal circumstances GUTENBERG should not be shown on Awesome Support ticket pages.)
	* Added a new wp-config option (WPAS_GUTENBERG_META_BOX_COMPATIBLE) to force the GUTENBERG editor to show up on the new ticket page. This is to be used strictly for testing only!
	* Added issuetracking and sla post types to the wpas_is_plugin_page() function.
	* Made the CHANNEL field available to hooks earlier when adding a ticket.	
	* Added new filter to control whether or not the list of tickets in the user profile widget is shown.  The filter name is wpas_user_profile_show_tickets.
	* Added new function for internal use - wpas_get_current_user_role
	* Add filters to check if user can reply or close a ticket from addons (wpas_user_can_reply_ticket and wpas_user_can_close_ticket.)
	
* Fix
	* Modified install/upgrade routine to check to see if a variable was null before attempting to use it
	* A 400 error was being generated when the agent was viewing tickets in the back end (caused by remote notifications class not being accessible when AJAX was used).
	* Restrict parsing of certain requests to the edit-ticket screen to prevent possible conflicts with other plugins
	* Replace the get_the_author_meta function calls with get_user_option for better multi-site compatibility.
	* Status filter on front-end was showing statuses commingled with PRIORITY when the priority field was enabled.
	* Login page had duplicate CSS IDs when registration was turned on.  New versions of the chrome browser are now flagging these as explicit errors in the browser console.
	* Make sure that users with the administer_awesome_support capability can see an accurate ticket count of all tickets in the menu (since they are a legitimate Awesome Support full admin and should see everything related to Awesome Support).
	* Users with administer_awesome_support capability should automatically see all tickets in the ticket list (unless overridden by the POWERPACK add-on security profiles).
	* Make sure topbar ticket count is correct for users with the administer_awesome_support capability.
	* Ticket counts at top of ticket list is now correct for users with administer_awesome_support capability.
	* Make radio button custom field labels clickable - thanks to [Talyash](https://github.com/talyash) for this contribution
	* Tickets were not going to INPROCESS under certain circumstances.  If the first agent reply on the ticket didn't change the status (eg: when using smart replies), it would never get changed on a normal agent reply in admin.  Now it does.
	* WooCommerce 3.x styles stepped all over some of the AS styles on AS pages. 
	* Added multiple checks for empty variables before attempting to use them (Thanks to George Lagonikas of subscriptiongroup.co.uk for submitting these.)
	* The attachments browse button overlapped the lower border on the default WP themes (2015/1/6/17) on the submit ticket form on the front-end.

	* No security fixes in this release

* New
	* DIVI theme compatibility layer
	
* Fix
	* WP 4.9 broke the color pickers
	
= 4.3.4 =

* Security Fixes
	* No security fixes in this release

* Fix
	* Remove errant javascript that was being queued in the logfile viewer area of the codebase

= 4.3.3 =

* Security Fixes
	* No security fixes in this release
	
* Tweak
	* Welcome page now has new tabs, links to documentation and is generally cleaned up to show more information in a better format.
	* Replaced a call to mkdir() with wp_mkdir_p() (contributed by lubobill1990)
	* Set a variable to type array if it's empty - just in case its empty because an array wasn't passed into the function (contributed by lubobill1990)
	* Replaced calls to update_user_meta with update_user_option instead (helps when users are on multi-site so that they can have different options on each site).

* New
	* Filter added to reply form - wpas_show_reply_form_front_end - can be used to control whether the reply form should be shown on the front-end.
	* Option to remove rating request in wp-admin footer.
	* Add new filter wpas_allow_loading - allow loading / not loading of AS - useful to avoid loading AS when traffic received is from a bot. 
	* Add new filter wpas_allow_soft_loading - allow loading / not loading of AS - useful to avoid loading AS when traffic received is from a bot. This one is different from the one above in that it uses a RETURN statement instead of a DIE statement when the filter evaluates to FALSE.
	* Add new internal function wpas_filter_input_server() that helps to work around a known PHP bug involving INPUT_SERVER and the FILTER_INPUT() function.

* Fix
	* class-logger __destruct was assuming a file name instead of a resource handle when attempting to close a file.
	* A function in class-logger were attempting to close a file using the filename instead of the file resource handle.
	* Log files need to be in separate folders when running under multi-site.
	* Fix: Core taxonomy custom fields were not using the slugs defined in wp-config.  This affected the PRODUCTS, DEPT, PRIORITY and CHANNEL fields that are shipped as part of core.  It also affected any user defined custom fields as it forced the rewrite slug to be the same as the name.

= 4.3.2 =

	* Remove log viewer tab in tools submenu if current user is not an admin

* Improvements
	* Changed the name of the quick-close and re-open links in the ticketlist because the WP auto-generated classnames for the link conflicted with Bootstrap 4 classnames (causing some wacky displays!)
	* Added quick-start instructions at the top of the ABOUT page that is shown when the plugin is activated.

	* [urgent] FAQs, DOCUMENTATION and other add-ons that used the reply-area in wp-admin had their select drop-downs disabled.  
	
= 4.2.1 =

* Improvements
	* Additional work was done on automatic upgrade routines 3.x.x to 4.2.x (please consider this experimental and BACKUP your database before upgrading!)
	
* Fix
	* Fix minor grammar issue on general settings tab.
	
* Notes
	* 4.2.0 was never submitted to the wordpress repo. So the upgrade is from 4.1.0 to 4.2.1, not 4.2.0 but includes all the 4.2.0 improvements and fixes outlined below.

= 4.2.0 =

* New
	* Added option to change the batch size used when cleaning up expired sessions
	* New: Filter added to INIT function in wpas-session class. You can use the new wpas_initiate_session_flag filter to disable creating the session. This would be useful when the traffic is coming from bot sources such as pingdom or uptimerobot.
	* New: Filter added to the wpas_can_reply_ticket function.  The new filter, wpas_can_also_reply_ticket, allows overriding the checks that determines if a user can reply to a ticket.
	
* Improvements
	* When filtering by ticket id, remove all other filters.
	* Added options to control which tabs are shown at the top of the TICKET LIST screen.	
	* Added automatic upgrade routines for 4.0.x to 4.2 and 3.x to 4.2 (both experimental)

* Fix
	* Disable product filter in ticket list since it doesn't work (and never worked)
	* The 3.x to 4.x upgrade routine name was incorrect
	* Removed unnecessary text from the TITLE of the email template.
	* Fix: Custom field attribute for Show In Front-end Detail was only working when the show column back end attribute was set to true. It now works regardless of the value of the show column attribute.
	
= 4.1.0 =

* New
	* Added TABS at the top of the ticket list screen to clean up the area. (***Depending on your theme this could be a minor breaking change!***)
	* Added new option in the SCREEN OPTIONS tab at the top of the ticket list screen to allow users to open ticket details in a new window/tab when the ID is clicked
	* (***Breaking Change***) Added two new custom field options: show_frontend_list and show_frontend_detail.  This allows users to control where a custom field will show up on the front end when viewing existing tickets.
	* Added new filter option for ticket list to show only those tickets waiting for reply
	* Added two new internal fields on the ticket cpt to store the last reply date and whether the ticket is waiting for a reply or not.
	* Experimental option to turn on bootstrap 4 styling.  Definitely not ready for prime-time but merged in for future use. Or it might be removed.
	* Experimental support for upgrades as far back as 3.2

* Fix
	* Custom field date types now have a dropdown calendar/datepicker in non-chrome browsers
	* System report would omit timezone if it was not set to a built-in city

* Improvements	
	* Tweak: Performance improvements on admin pages when there are a large number of products 
	* Tweak: Remove the option to EDIT from the BULK ACTIONS menu when viewing the ticket list. Using it could corrupt the database when multiple taxonomy option items were added to a taxonomy field.
	* Tweak: Updated the SELECT2 library to version 4.0.3
	* Tweak: Updated titan framework library EDD plugin Updater to 1.6.4 which fixes a few items including reducing the number of license calls to the add-ons licensing server
	* (***Breaking Change***)  Tweak: Custom field attribute show_column is now only used to control whether the column shows up on the back-end ticket list.  Use the new show_frontend_list and show_frontend_detail attributes to control where and how a column shows up on the front end.
	* Tweak: Compatibility layer for certain themes that load different versions of the select2 file.  We now include the full select2 distribution as an option that can be set in TICKETS->SETTINGS->ADVANCED
	* Tweak: Improved WPML compatibility (Thanks to David Garcia Watkins from WPML for contributing this improvement on github)
	* Tweak: Better sorting of the activity column in ticket list.  
	* Tweak: Better performance when sorting the activity list
	* Tweak: Internal function update to the list of custom post types that qualify as being owned by awesome-support
	* Tweak: Layouts on very small mobile screens
	
= 4.0.6 =

* New
	* Added infrastructure code to allow the use of TABS in the reply area by add-ons.  This means that the never ending size of the reply area is now more manageble since add-ons can now place their UI in a tab.
* Improvements	
	* Tweak: Only update CHANNEL in wpas_insert_ticket if channel field is blank.  This allows some other filter/action hooks to override the default channel.
	* Tweak: Modified notifications class so it can be extended.
	
= 4.0.5 =

* Improvements
	* Add some new options to control how attachment links are shown on tickets.  Some servers cannot handle our masked attachment links because of mis-configuration so now have option to use unmasked links
	* Add option to control the contents of the .htaccess file that protect an individual ticket upload folder.
	* Modifications to email notifications to support new features in the POWERPACK (Productivity) add-on.
	* Added the ability to optionally view the open date and the close date in GMT format in the activity column.
	* Added option to show the length of time a ticket was opened in the activity column.  Only applies to closed tickets.
	* Show full date/time for replies when user hovers.
	* Show time elasped since ticket was open on replies when user hovers.
	* Changed upgrade routine name to make sure it runs when upgrading from 3.x.
	* Simplified logic related to when the AWAITING REPLY tag is shown.  Before it was shown to agents who were not involved on a ticket even if another agent had already replied to the ticket.
	* Always show the agent column in the admin ticket list.  Before, we would remove that column if an agent who was not an admin was viewing the list.

* Bugfixes
	* php warning was being thrown if product syncing was enabled but user did not click the SAVE button in the PRODUCTS tab on the SETTINGS screen.

= 4.0.4 =

	* Add new function to generate an MD5 hash

* Bugfixes
	* For full product resync under the TOOLS menu option do not delete the existing products in the AS product taxonomy if they are used in tickets already
	* Verify that a folder is writable before writing a .htaccess file to it.
	* Check for empty value after calling a function in the stakeholders.php metabox code.  Prevents debug.log error from being thrown while still allowing for the proper agent dropdown to be shown on the screen.
	* Issue with activation on multisite single-blog mode - activation was not completing properly.
	* Issue with licensing infrastructure for add-ons. Not all licenses would allow for activation after the licensing server software was updated
	

= 4.0.3 =

* Bugfixes
	* Check for the existence of a function before using it in our custom fields class.
	* Fixed an issue where dropdowns created by our built-in dropdown functions would not return the correct value because of a datatype casting error
	* Fixed an issue where a warning was being thrown about 'original post status'.

* Improvements

= 4.0.2 =

* Bugfixes
	* Incorrect error message shown when PHP version is not adequate.
	* Compatibility shim for sensei plugin - it pukes post ids indiscrimnately on all custom post type pages so we have to disable it on our pages.
	* Ticket slug settings were not being respected when the ticket was opened in wp-admin.
	* Applied an explicity INT cast to the time tracking fields when retriving data (just in case they somehow end up with non-numeric data)
	* Admin ticket list lost the email address for the ticket creator.

= 4.0.1 =

* Forcing a minor update through to force the svn repo to resync properly.

= 4.0.0 =
* New	
	* Minimum required version of PHP is now 5.6
	* Minimum required version of WP is the 4.x line.
	* Major revamp of sorting and filtering capabilities
		* More taxonomy fields now work when filtering and sorting
		* Can enter a ticket number to find a ticket quickly
		* All other fields can sort or filter
			* Exception: Product - can only sort on Product not filter (filter will be added in a future version)
			* Exception: Agent - can only filter on agent; cannot sort by it.
	* Added a set of fields that will be used for time tracking.
		* Basic time tracking so agent can set time spent on ticket.
		* Notes fields
		* Options to show/not show the fields on the ticket
		* Options to show/not show the fields in the ticket list on the back end
		* Options to show the fields disabled on the ticket (used when another plugin is updating the fields)
	* Added two "Additional Agent" fields.  These agents can be notified of ticket events and can see the tickets in their ticket list.
		* Limitation: There are no email template tags for additional agents to all emails CCed to the additional agents will still reference the primary agent.
	* You can now set the number of tickets per page that is shown on the front end.  The default is still 5.  (Some customers had hundreds of tickets for clients based on how they were using the plugin).
	* Custom fields:
		* Now have an option to be "backend" only.  (Documentation to be updated after release).
		* Can now be set as "readonly". (Documentation to be updated after release).
		* Now have options to control capabilities specific to custom taxonomy fields.
	* There is now a new explicit field for ticket PRIORITY.  You can configure your own priorities and color code them.  This field is optional and can be turned on for the front-end, back-end or both and can be made mandatory or optional.
		* If a priority is set and a color is chosen for the priority then the ticket header will change to reflect that color.
	* There is a new optional CHANNEL field that allows you to select where a help request originated. The drop-down is pre-configured with a number of common channels such as FACEBOOK and EMAIL.  In many instances it will be up to the agent to fill in the field - it is not automatically populated in most cases. But it is automatically populated and set for tickets generated from the standard ticket form, gravity forms and those opened via email.
	* Added internal fields to store a count of the number of replies on a ticket.  This is going to be useful on reports.
		* Use the button under the TOOLS->SETTINGS->CLEANUP tab to update the fields on older tickets.
	* Added a set of fields to store "additional interested parties".  These are simply notational fields that do nothing right now but they set the stage for future alerts and notices.
	* Save the date the ticket was closed in new metafields.  Before, the date the ticket was closed was not explicitly saved which made it very hard to use the closing date on reports.
	* New WordPress Capabilities have been added:
		* view_all_tickets.  This allows non-admin agents to view and update all tickets in the ticket list if the capability is assigned.
		* view_unassigned_tickets: This allows non-admin agents to view and update unassigned tickets if the capability is assigned.
		* manage_licenses_for_awesome_support:  This allows the license box to be hidden.  It is now only shown to admin users by default.
		* administer_awesome_support: Will be used in future versions and add-ons to limit certain things to Awesome Support admins instead of forcing users to log in with full WP Admin capabilities
		* Other capabilities specifc to the new pre-installed custom taxonomies.
	* Add new options for specifying the ticket slug (post id, random number, guid are now options.  See TICKETS->Settings->Advanced)
	* When replying to a ticket you can choose whether to automatically go to the next ticket in the list or the previous ticket in the list (in addition to the prior options of staying in the ticket and going back to the ticket list).
	* Add ticket id to front end ticket list.
	* Labels for built-in custom fields can now be retrieved from the OPTIONS array if they exist otherwise default to built-in text values
	* Add action hooks:
		* execute_additional_tools to allow add-ons to add their own buttons to the TOOLS->CLEANUP tab.
		* wpas_show_done_tool_message allow add-ons to show a message after running a tool.
		* wpas_backend_ticket_stakeholders_before to allow add-ons to access the the stakeholders metabox
		* wpas_insert_reply_admin_failed to hook into failed replies from the back-end (rare event, should never be needed but added just in case)
		* wpas_ticket_after_update_admin_success to hook into updates done from the admin screen
		* wpas_insert_reply_admin_success to hook into replies done from the admin screen
		* wpas_post_new_ticket_admin to hook into new tickets done from the admin screen
	* Add filter hooks:

		* wpas_fe_template_detail_author_avatar allows for the opportunity to change the avatar in the details template on the front end
		* wpas_fe_template_detail_author_display_name allows for the opportunity to change the display name in the details template on the front end
	* wpas_dropdown now supports a "multiple" attribute
	* Politely requests user to rate after 25 closed tickets.
	
* Improvements
	* Action hook wpas_insert_ticket is now passing an additional parameter containing the original data received before any changes.
	* Cleaned up Custom Post Type definitions for ticket replies, logs and history so that third party tools can more easily identify them. Prior to this change they all appeared with the name "POSTS" to third party tools which wasn't very useful.
	* Checkbox custom field can now be shown on the TICKET LIST screen on the back end.
	* Some Internal updates to support the add-on infrastructure for certain add-ons.
		* Functions in functions-email-notifications.php uses a new hook wpas_add_reply_complete so that email notifications now occur AFTER attachments have been processed
		* A similar hook was added/modified in functions-post.php for the same reason
		* Added a couple of functions to get tickets belonging to a particular agent
		* Added hooks in the ticket details metabox to be able to add content before and after the default ticket content
		* Added processing code for using an ATTACHMENTS tag in email templates
		* Adjusted the location where custom fields data is updated in the ticket.  This is an internal change to ensure that certain alerts have access to the information stored in custom fields.
		* Updated to allow custom fields to show in the user profile (under very limited and narrow circumstances this is ok but not intended for use by outside developers)
	* Settings screen changes
		* New tab for Basic Time Tracking fields
		* New tab for Products configuration
	Uninstall Routine Updates:
		* Delete ticket attachment folders on the local drives
		* Uninstall the new taxonomy fields introduced in this version

* Bugfixes
	* Cleaned up a few PHP notices
	* Allow translation of PRODUCT and DEPARTMENT header on ticket list (backend)
	* The USER PROFILE metabox/widget on the ticket detail page now shows the full count of open/closed tickets with or without filters applied.  It will now always show the real count regardless of the number of tickets listed underneat the summary.
	* Show more than 10 add-ons in the ADD-ONs screen
	* Better sychronization between Custom Status and the TICKETS->SETTINGS->STYLE tab.
		* To make sync work properly you need to first manually make sure that your color settings in the Tickets->Settings->Style tab matches the ones in Custom Status. Once that is done syncing between core the the add-on will work properly.
		* When the agent selected "Back to List" for their "after reply" action in their personal profile, this action did not work.  Fixed.
	* Removed the word "PUBLIC" from certain template tags that aren't really public options
	* Only activate plugin on single site activation.  Network activation on multi-site should do nothing now since there is no specific multisite functionality available.
	* Removed use of legacy method to check of custom field exists.
	* Custom fields could not handle multiple checkbox values being stored.
	* Updated default styles on checkbox and radio button custom fields.
	* Remove some unused code.

	* BREAKING CHANGE: Change a hook with an incorrect name that was used when defining the Deparment taxonomy.  Any modifications using the old hook name will need to be updated to use the new name.
	
* Upgrade Instructions
	* After installing the new version please go to your TICKETS->SETTINGS tabs and click the SAVE CHANGES button to write the defaults for new options to your database.
	* If it seems that certain options are missing from your TICKETS menu or your TICKETS->SETTINGS screen then please go to TICKETS->TOOLS->CLEANUP and click the button to re-run the 3.3.4 to 4.0.0 upgrade.  This will add in any missing WordPress security capabilities to your installation.
	
* Deprecated or Removed	
	* PHP 5.2 and PHP 5.3 no longer supported.  Portions of the plugin were not supported by 5.2 for a while now but going forward no testing will be done on PHP 5.2.   The minimum supported PHP version is 5.6.3.

== Upgrade Notice ==
The version 4.x.x line is a MAJOR upgrade from 3.x.x.  It is strongly suggested that you test this upgrade in a stage/test environment before applying it to your production site.  
At the very least you should back-up your site before applying this update!

After upgrading please make sure you install the latest version of add-ons as well - especially the Email Support add-on (Version 5.0.x) and Gravity Forms.

Automatic upgrades to 4.0.0 are only supported from version 3.3.4. If you are running an earlier version in the 3.x line please make sure you upgrade to 3.3.4 FIRST, verify that all your settings are intact and then install version 4.
Upgrades from the version 2.x and 1.x lines are NOT supported at all.

After upgrading you might notice that menu options under TICKETS are missing or the tabs inside your TICKETS->SETTINGS screen are missing.  If so, please try any or all of the following:

	1. Go to TICKETS->TOOLS->CLEANUP and find the upgrade button and click that to re-run the upgrade.  This will add required WordPress security capabilities back to the system.
	2. Go to your TICKETS->SETTINGS screen and click the SAVE button.  This adds the default settings that are new for version 4.0 to your installation.
	3. Deactivate the add-on and re-activate it.  This triggers some housekeeping tasks.
