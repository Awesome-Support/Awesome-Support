== Installation ==

= Using The WordPress Dashboard =

1. Navigate to the 'Add New' in the plugins dashboard
2. Search for 'Awesome Support'
3. Click 'Install Now'
4. Activate the plugin on the Plugin dashboard

= Uploading in WordPress Dashboard =

1. Download `awesome-support.zip` from this page
2. Navigate to the 'Add New' in the plugins dashboard
3. Navigate to the 'Upload' area
4. Select `awesome-support.zip` from your computer
5. Click 'Install Now'
6. Activate the plugin in the Plugin dashboard

= Using FTP =

1. Download `awesome-support.zip` from this page
2. Extract the `awesome-support` directory to your computer
3. Upload the `awesome-support` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
4. Activate the plugin in the Plugin dashboard

= Setup =

Whatever the method you used, after you activated the plugin through the plugins dashboard, the setup is done silently in the background.

Two new pages will be added to your site:

- My Tickets
- Submit ticket

Add those two pages to your menu in order to give your users easy access to their support area.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= I've installed the plugin - now what? =

Now you can [read our post installation instructions](https://getawesomesupport.com/documentation/awesome-support/post-installation-need-know-quick-start/) or [watch the installation videos](https://getawesomesupport.com/videos/)

= Weird or scrambled UI in wp-admin on the ticket screen after upgrading to 5.0 =

This can happen because old JS and CSS files are cached in your browser.  On most browsers you can use the CTRL-F5 key on any Awesome Support page to force a full refresh.

= Missing tabs or menu options after upgrading from version 3.x to 5.x =

This happens because new WordPress custom security capabilities were introduced in version 4.0.0 of Awesome Support.  [Read this FAQ on our site to learn how adjust your system for these new security items.](https://getawesomesupport.com/question/missing-tabs-menu-options-version-4-0-upgrade/)

= I get a blank page after ticket submission =

This is most likely a permalinks issue. What you need to do is log into your WordPress admin, go to *Settings > Permalinks* and hit the *Save* button. You don't actually need to change anything, just hitting *Save* will refresh your permalinks structure, including the new `ticket` post type.

= The plugin data isn't removed from the database after uninstall =

If you want to delete the plugin and all of its data, you need to go to the *Advanced* tab in the plugin settings and check the *Delete Data* option. Only then the data will be removed from the database during the uninstall process.

= Users get "You do not have the capacity to open a new ticket" =

Normally, when a user registers through the plugin, he/she is given the role *Support User*. [This role has special capabilities](http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities).

If your users get the error message *"You do not have the capacity to open a new ticket"*, it means that they don't have the special capabilities.  This can happen when you install into an existing site and your users already have a role assigned.

Here you have two choices:

1. Change all your users' role to *Support User*
2. Give the role you want to use (eg. *Subscriber*) the special capabilities

If you don't know how to add new capabilities to a role, we suggest you use a plugin like [User Role Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-role-editor/) and give the desired role the following capabilities:

- `view_ticket`
- `create_ticket`
- `close_ticket`
- `reply_ticket`
- `attach_files`

**Do not give your users more than those 5 capabilities**, otherwise they could get administrative privileges.

= How to disable agent auto-assignment =

If you need to disable the auto-assignment function and hence have all new tickets assigned to the default agent (set in the plugin general settings), you can add this constant in your theme's `functions.php` file:

`
define( 'WPAS_DISABLE_AUTO_ASSIGN', true );
`

= How to set the product field as mandatory? =

If you have enabled multi-products support and want to make the "Product" field in the submission form mandatory, just add the following code snippet to your theme's `functions.php` file: https://gist.github.com/julien731/a519956ce9c81542439c. Alternatively, if you don't want to mess with code you can pick up our POWERPACK add-on where you can tick a box to turn this feature on.

= How to change the tickets slug? =

By default, all tickets will be accessed through a URL of the type domain.com/ticket/my-ticket-title.

If you wish to change the slug `ticket` to something else, let's say `help`, so that your URLs look like domain.com/help/my-ticket-title, you need to add a constant in your theme's `functions.php` file as follows:

`
define( 'WPAS_SLUG', 'my_new_slug' );
`

= I don't receive e-mail notifications =

There are several factors that can influence e-mail notifications delivery. Please read this article for details: https://getawesomesupport.com/email-notifications-awesome-support-wordpress/

  * Gutenberg/block editor translation process has changed so had to change our Gutenberg block code to accommodate.
  * Ensure that all custom taxonomies have their "back to items" item set properly. Before, every custom taxonomy would say "back to categories" when a taxonomy item was edited and saved.
  * Remove a close link in the ticket reply area if the agent does not have the 'close_ticket' capability set.
  * The "can be assigned" field was not showing up unless the agent was a WP administrator. We're now using the wpas_is_asadmin() function to qualify who can see this field.
  * The departments options was not showing up in the user profile unless the agent was a WP administrator. We're now using the wpas_is_asadmin() function to qualify who can see this field.
  * Do not load the editor script on all wp-admin pages - only load on our pages.

* Tweak
  * Added schemas to some REST API routes that didn't have them
  * Using latest release version of the Titan Framework (1.12.1) This results in some slight UI changes to the settings screen - especially drop-downs that now use SELECT2 boxes by default.
  * File-Uploader Class - Make sure a required function exists before using it. (For some reason sometimes it does not, especially when called from our gravity forms add-on.)
  * Added option to load earlier versions of select2
  * Cleaned up logic related to messages shown when ticket failed to close properly on the back-end.
  * Cleaned up logic related to messages shown when ticket failed to close properly on the front-end.
  * Overlays: Made styling for input and select buttons for certain overlays specific to the Ticket-list page instead of overriding all the other ticket pages.
  * Renamed certain sections of the TICKETS->SETTING->EMAILS tab and added descriptive text to certain other items.

* Security Fixes
  * Sanitize the ticket post title when tickets are submitted from the admin area by agents and admins.

* The Phoenix reborn. An entirely new version of Awesome Support

== Upgrade Notice ==
The version 4.x.x line is a MAJOR upgrade from 3.x.x.  It is strongly suggested that you test this upgrade in a stage/test environment before applying it to your production site.
At the very least you should back-up your site before applying this update!

After upgrading please make sure you install the latest version of add-ons as well - especially the Email Support add-on (Version 5.0.x) and Gravity Forms.

Automatic upgrades to 4.0.0 are only supported from version 3.3.4. If you are running an earlier version in the 3.x line please make sure you upgrade to 3.3.4 FIRST, verify that all your settings are intact and then install version 4.
Upgrades from the version 2.x and 1.x lines are NOT supported at all.

After upgrading you might notice that menu options under TICKETS are missing or the tabs inside your TICKETS->SETTINGS screen are missing.  If so, please try any or all of the following:

	1. Go to TICKETS->TOOLS->CLEANUP and find the upgrade button and click that to re-run the upgrade.  This will add required WordPress security capabilities back to the system.
	2. Go to your TICKETS->SETTINGS screen and click the SAVE button.  This adds the default settings that are new for version 4.0 to your installation.
	3. Deactivate the add-on and re-activate it.  This triggers some housekeeping tasks.
