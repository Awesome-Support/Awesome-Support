# Travis CI Configuration File

# Tell Travis CI we're using PHP
language: php

# Use the container-based infrastructure
sudo: false

# PHP version used in first build configuration.
php:
#    - "7.1"
#    - "7.0"
    - "5.6"
#    - "5.5"
#    - "5.2"

# WordPress version used in first build configuration.
# We test 4 versions back
# We used to test the 3.x lines which was announced as compatible but removed that as of AS 4.0.0.
env:
    - WP_VERSION=master
    - WP_VERSION=4.7.5
    - WP_VERSION=4.6
    - WP_VERSION=4.5
#    - WP_VERSION=4.4
#    - WP_VERSION=4.3
#    - WP_VERSION=3.8

# Next we define our matrix of additional build configurations to test against.
# The versions listed above will automatically create our first configuration,
# so it doesn't need to be re-defined below.

# WP_VERSION specifies the tag to use. The way these tests are configured to run
# requires at least WordPress 3.8. Specify "master" to test against SVN trunk.

# Note that Travis CI supports listing these above to automatically build a
# matrix of configurations, but we're being nice here by manually building a
# fewer configurations even though we're testing 3 versions of PHP
# along with 4 versions of WordPress (which would build 15 configs otherwise).
# This takes half as long to run while still providing adequate coverage.
